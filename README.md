Feature Road Map

Features I would love to build in the feature would include more robust querying, pagination, segrating the code into controller, service, and data access layers. I would add more robust input validations.  I would also like to build out users, and allow users to connect with friends, rate movies, and write reviews. Another really cool feature would allow you to build a "watch" list where you are prompted movies and select yes or no for interest. Then when you get together for movie night with friends the app will look at the common interest of the group and recommend the best movie for the group based on everyones selections, basically a mutual or tinder for movie night!
